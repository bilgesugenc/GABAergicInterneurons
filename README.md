# GABAergic Interneurons
Abstract

GABAergic interneurons regulate cortical neural networks by providing inhibitory inputs.
Their loss or dysfunction in the cerebral cortex leads to neurodevelopmental disorders such
as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and epilepsy. Therefore, there has been a
growing interest in the reproducible and highly efficient generation of cortical GABAergic
interneurons. In vitro, the generation of GABAergic interneurons from human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs) is crucial for studying human-specific cellular and functional properties during
development, which cannot be modeled in other species with lower complexity. Also, these
in vitro-derived cells are good candidates for future therapeutic cell replacement therapies.

Here I describe a protocol for generating cortical interneurons from hiPSCs towards medial
ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived ventral progenitors and further into GABAergic
interneurons. I have established the protocol by comparing and combining several published
protocols with the goal of achieving a high percentage of GABAergic interneurons which can
also be scaled up to obtain a large number of cells. I verified the identity of cells via staining
and RT-qPCR at different time points (progenitor and neuronal stages) for a panel of medial
ganglionic eminence (MGE), GABAergic, and neuronal markers. These showed a purity of up
to 80% of my differentiation protocol. I further explored the functionality of the generated
neurons running migration assays in vitro and ex vivo to observe their distinct migration
behavior, as they migrate tangentially in the brain, also in comparison to the cortical
projection neurons, which migrate radially in the cortex migration. Overall, I have established
a reproducible protocol that generates 80% GABAergic markers able to migrate in vitro.
