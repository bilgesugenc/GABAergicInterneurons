# The generation of GABAergic Interneurons from human iPSCs
## Introduction

GABAergic interneurons regulate cortical neural networks by providing inhibitory inputs.
Their loss or dysfunction in the cerebral cortex leads to neurodevelopmental disorders such
as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and epilepsy. Therefore, there has been a
growing interest in the reproducible and highly efficient generation of cortical GABAergic
interneurons. In vitro, the generation of GABAergic interneurons from human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs) is crucial for studying human-specific cellular and functional properties during
development, which cannot be modeled in other species with lower complexity. Also, these
in vitro-derived cells are good candidates for future therapeutic cell replacement therapies.

## Aim
Here I describe a protocol for generating cortical interneurons from hiPSCs towards medial
ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived ventral progenitors and further into GABAergic
interneurons. I have established the protocol by comparing and combining several published
protocols with the goal of achieving a high percentage of GABAergic interneurons which can
also be scaled up to obtain a large number of cells (Close et al., 2017; Schuster et al., 2019; 
Shi et al., 2012; Strano et al., 2020). Then, further optimization was performed: the dose of
SHH and WNT inhibitor, the type of WNT inhibitor, the presence of PMA, different cell densities 
and different splitting days.

## Materials and methods

## Results
I verified the identity of cells via staining and RT-qPCR at different time points (progenitor and 
neuronal stages) for a panel of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), GABAergic, and neuronal markers. 
These showed a purity of up to 80% of my differentiation protocol.
